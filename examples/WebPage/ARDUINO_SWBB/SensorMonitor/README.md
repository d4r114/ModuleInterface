# SensorMonitor sketch
This is a slightly modified version of the main SensorMonitor example.
It reads a light sensor  and has a different bus id, that's about it. You can connect a motion sensor as well, and it will be logged to the database, but the LightController sketch does not use it. It could be a simple exercise to extend the LightController sketch to turn the light on when motion is detected.
